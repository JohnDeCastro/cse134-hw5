For HW5, there were some new features to my site which includes the addition of an "Experience" page where I add a new custom web component <experience-card> built using JavaScript and the Shadow DOM. I included some styling to fit the overall theme of my site so it could be minimal, yet clearly defined and easy on the eyes. HW5 had me implementing 2 new buttons, "Load Local" & "Load Remote", whose purpose is to dynamically populate the new cards by either using localStorage or a remote JSON API via fetch(), respectively. These new additions to my site allow me to express meaningful life experiences in an interactive and reusable format while also allowing me to learn more about modern JavaScript.
